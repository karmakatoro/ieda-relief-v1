In international operations, IEDA Relief assesses shelter needs and provides families with temporary or semi-permanent solutions that give residents a sense of security after fleeing their homes. With help from other humanitarian partners, IEDA Relief also provides non-food items (NFIs) such as clothing, bedding and cooking sets to ensure more than just a roof overhead. Constructing and/or rebuilding infrastructure is key to providing sustainable solutions for displaced populations. Internationally, IEDA Relief often carries out infrastructure projects that facilitate access to disadvantaged populations, such as the opening or reopening of rural roads. In camps, IEDA Relief constructs and maintains community structures for food distribution, community gatherings, and the storage of materials. When the crisis has subsided, we also assist returnees and other vulnerable households with the reconstruction and/or rehabilitation of homes and public institutions (e.g. schools and hospitals) that were damaged or destroyed by conflict or natural disasters.",
